This project implements a live cryptocurrency spot trading algorithm that uses real-time order book data and price information (sourced from Binance) to make automated buy and sell decisions. 
The central logic is encapsulated in the SpotTradingAlgo class, which manages capital, open positions, trading signals, and performance metrics. At each step, the algorithm fetches the current order book and price, analyzes the top levels of bid and ask data to assess spread, volume imbalance, and depth imbalance, then decides whether to enter or exit a position. Trades are executed based on configurable thresholds: alpha (volume imbalance), beta (depth imbalance) and only when the potential edge outweighs trading fees. Positions are closed using stop-loss and take-profit logic. The system tracks each trade, calculates PnL (after fees), and continuously logs outcomes. A live loop (run_live_trading) orchestrates this process at a fixed interval, printing trade activity and capital evolution. The code is designed to simulate and evaluate strategy performance, though it doesn't place real trades.
